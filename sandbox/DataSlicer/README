Running is very simple.
Just need to add the 'src' folder to PYTHONPATH and 'export' it so it's visible to subprocesses.
In bash/zsh, this looks like:

  $ cd DataSlicer
  $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src

Then you can get usage info as:
  $ bin/tf-dataslice.py -h

Sample invocation (NOTE I'm not checking the sample data file in, you have to copy that manually):
  $ bin/tf-dataslice.py -f data/testdata.json -o data/testdata-timeslice.json
